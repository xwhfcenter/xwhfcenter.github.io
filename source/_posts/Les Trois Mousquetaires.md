Les Trois Mousquetaires is a novel written by Alexandre Dumas(1802.7—1870.12), a French romantic writer of the nineteenth century.

The story happened in the seventeenth century and was set in the La Rochelle Siege. In 1610, Henry IV was assassinated by a crazy Catholic. The successor young Louis XIII, ruled France with the regent of his mother. Following the failure of French infighting between the nobilities belonged to Catholic or Huguenot, the responsibility to steady and strengthen French despotism, would be taken, by his prime minister, cardinal, Richelieu. That is why, after Duke Loens and Prince of Soubise as the leaders who had connected with the Britain to oppose the government, made a rebellion. The prime minister launched a war against La Rochelle.

D’Artagnan, a nineteen-year-old Gaston,“face long and brown; high cheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected, even without his cap—and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man“.

Through D’Artagnan, who is nearly the same young as I am, I can see myself in him. Without authority, did he enter Paris(like Beijing) alone owning wild ambition to the future; he had countless desire even in dreams but what he got was only have an empty wallet.

However, it was the fact that D’Artagnan is not only an excellent and but also a lucky guy. There are millions of excellent qualities in his blood: brave but careful, smart and faithful, and so on.

It is important that he became friendly with three persons due to those unique qualities: Athos, Aramis, Porthos. The four inseparable enviable companions, shared and shared alike. Finally, after experiencing a series of misfortune and struggle, every one of them reaped a satisfying ending.

For me, after reading the story, I was attracted and also moved by their friendship. It is gratifying that there are at least a few persons who are willing to accompany with you, care for you requiring no rewards and listen to your complain. As an old Chinese saying goes, "If you had got a close friend, life would be enough."
